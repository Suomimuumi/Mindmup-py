# Mindmup-py
This open source Python project allow you to create JSON data trees using Minmup.com. I try to develop this project all the time. But feel free to use :).

This project started at 1/29/2022.

The MindMup-py.exe will work, if you have python already installed in your pc.
The project is 100% open source. So if it doesen't work: you can always code it better by you self :).
